            <p> <strong>Hello world !</strong>
              <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
                This portfolio demostrates the web development skills that I have managed to acquire in my coding class studies.My name is <b>Hosana Joshua</b>. This is my first portfolio to be designed with the help of coding classes from moringa school.
            <p>Check out or visit Moringa School <a href="https://moringaschool.com/programs/">here.</a></p>

                    <p>I have worked on various projects such as a pet website I did as I learnt coding at My 
                    beginner level.</p>
                    <p>Coding is my passion. This is because it helps to keep me busy and gives me challenges to brainstorm me increasing my exposure to the fast moving technology world.</p>
                    <p>This is just a start of it but not the end of lerning. I hope to do much better than this and become the best in the IT industry.All patries are welcome to help improve the code to enhance it to become more appealing</p>
                    <p>The following are some of the images that I like which depict coding.</p>
